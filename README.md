<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Web Scrapper for College Professor's educational background utilizing Python and Beautiful Soup 4. The project grabs data from a set URL - in this case the USC Viterbi faculty page. From the faculty page, the webscraper finds all the professor's individual pages. Afterwards, the webscraper then scrapes each professor's individual page to college information such as name, occupation, and degrees from the individual professor. We have accounted for possible internet errors through keeping track of the URLs of professors the first run did not receive information for. The data is then stored in a local database by last name order.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install postgresSQL 
Inside postgresSQL, create database called 'collegeprofessorinfos'

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/wirefailed/collegeprofessorswebscrap.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Run main.py and answer all the questions
   ```zsh
   python main.py
   ```

   As shown on the image, it will store it like this on PostgresSql

2. Search professors' backgrounds by running `searchingalgorithm.py`
   ```zsh
   python searchingalgorithm.py
   ```

   For example, the result will come out like this:

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Install BeautifulSoup4 and psycopg2
- [x] Go to https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty and understand its properties in HTML
- [x] Use BeautifulSoup4 to get a list of all professors with link that accesses to their personal website
- [x] Once again, understand how each website contains data and use BeautifulSoup4 to store in multi dimensional array
- [x] Use psycopg2 to store the list of professors and their occupations inside one table
- [x] Create another table that stores their degrees with foreign key that connects both tables
- [x] Create another file that help searches professors' degrees using PostgresSQL using Join, LIKE, and etc...
